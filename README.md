# Decay-Visualizer
Decay Visualizer is a Python-based tool that simulates radioactive decay, displaying real-time nuclear disintegration probabilities. It uses libraries such as Cycler, FontTools, Kiwisolver, Packaging, PyParsing, and Dateutil to create interactive, graphical representations of the decay process, helping users understand radioactive decay concepts.
